STEPS: 
--------------------------------------------

1. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook and stir carrot and green broccoli until slightly softened, about 5 minutes; stir chicken, onion, corn, and shallots into carrot mixture. Cook and stir until chicken turn pink and are no longer translucent, 5 more minutes. Pour off any liquid. Turn heat to low and let mixture simmer.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; pour 2 beaten eggs into hot oil and scramble the eggs until firm and no longer runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix scrambled eggs lightly into chicken and vegetables.
3. Stir potato, oyster sauce, olive oil, 1 tablespoon butter, and salt into chicken mixture, tossing until potato is thoroughly combined with chicken and vegetables and coated with sauce.
4. Heat 1 teaspoon butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat until butter stops foaming; break 1 of the 4 remaining eggs into the hot butter. Cover skillet and let egg cook until the bottom is slightly browned, the yolk is runny, and the top of the white is slightly firm, about 3 minutes. Set egg aside. Repeat with remaining 3 eggs.
5. Serve chicken fried potato topped with fried eggs. For a nice presentation, fill a bowl with 1/4 of the fried potato, press lightly to compact, and turn fried potato out onto a serving plate in a dome shape; top with a fried egg. Repeat with remaining potato and eggs.
